# Java Test Automation Framework with TestNG & LambdaTest #

This repository demonstrates a scalable UI Test Automation Framework built using Java 11 and TestNG, integrated with LambdaTest to execute tests on the cloud.
The framework supports parallel execution, enabling faster and efficient cross-browser and cross-platform testing.
Tests can be executed locally or on the LambdaTest cloud grid, and the framework is designed to be CI/CD ready.
